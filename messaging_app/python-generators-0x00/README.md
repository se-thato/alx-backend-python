#  Python Generators and Data Streaming Project

This project introduces advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations.

The focus is on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide **iterative access** to data—promoting optimal resource utilization and boosting performance in data-driven applications.




##  Requirements

To complete this project successfully, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- Knowledge of:
  - `yield` and generator functions
  - SQL and relational database systems (MySQL and/or SQLite)
  - Basic schema design and data seeding practices
  - Git and GitHub for version control



##  Project Highlights

- Stream data from SQL databases using generator functions
- Efficiently seed databases and fetch rows without loading the entire dataset into memory
- Build tools to process large datasets in chunks or on-demand
- Integrate SQL with Python for real-time computation and querying
